Comments in JavaScript are essential for code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among
developers. They serve several important purposes.

1. Comments provide explanations and context about the code's purpose, logic, and
functionalityG This makes it easier for other developers (or your future self) to understand and work with the
code.


2. Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "comment out" code during debugging,
helping you isolate issues without deleting code.


3. Comments allow developers to communicate with each other, explaining why certain
decisions were made or describing how specific code segments work.


4. Comments can be used to divide code into logical sections, making it easier to navigate and
maintain larger codebases.


5. In some cases, comments may be required to explain licensing, copyright
information, or compliance with regulations.
