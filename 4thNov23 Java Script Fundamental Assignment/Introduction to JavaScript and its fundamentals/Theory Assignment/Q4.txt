Purpose of Declaring Variables in JavaScript:


The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to reserve a memory location for storing data values that
can be used throughout a program. Variables act as placeholders for data, making it easier to work with and
manipulate information in your code. Declaring variables allows you to:


1. Store Data: Variables can store various types of data, such as numbers, text, and objects.


2. Manipulate Data: You can perform operations on the data stored in variables, such as calculations,
concatenations, and comparisons.


3. Reuse Data: Variables enable you to reuse values at different points in your code, reducing redundancy.


4. Control Flow: Variables can be used to control the flow of your program through conditions and loops.
