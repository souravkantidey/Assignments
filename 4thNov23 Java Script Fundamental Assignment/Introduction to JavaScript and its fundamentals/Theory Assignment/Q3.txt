JavaScript has five primitive data types, which are the simplest and most fundamental data types.


1. Number: The number data type represents numeric values. It can include integers, floating-point numbers,
and special values like NaN (Not-a-Number) and Infinity.

2. String: The string data type represents sequences of characters enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks (` `)
quotes. Strings are used to represent text data.

3. Boolean: The boolean data type has only two values, true and false, and is used to represent logical values. Booleans are
commonly used for conditions and comparisons.

4. Null: The null data type represents the intentional absence of any object value or a value that has been explicitly set
to indicate no value. It is often used to initialize variables before assigning meaningful values.

5. Undefined: The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is
often the initial value of variables.
