/*Declaring Variables using the 'let' Keyword:

In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the 'let' keywordG Here's the basic syntax for declaring a variable */

let variableName;

/* let: This keyword indicates that you are declaring a variable.

variableName: Replace this with the name you want to give to your variable. It should follow JavaScript's
variable naming rules, such as starting with a letter, using letters, numbers, or underscores, and being case
sensitive. */

//Example of declaring and initializing a variable:

let age; // Declaration

age = 30; // Initialization

//You can also declare and initialize a variable in a single line:

let name = "John"; // Declaration and initialization

/* It's important to note that 'let' variables have block scope, which means they are limited to the block or function
in which they are declared. This scope behavior helps prevent unintended variable name conflicts and is part
of JavaScript's ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) language specification. */
