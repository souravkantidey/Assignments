/*During code reviews, meaningful variable names make it easier for reviewers to provide
feedback and identify potential issues.


Example Demonstrating the Importance of Descriptive Variable Names:


Consider the following example, where two variables store the price and quantity of a product. One uses a
meaningful name (productPrice and productQuantity), while the other uses less descriptive names (a and b):*/

// Less Descriptive Variable Names

let a = 10; // Price of the product

let b = 5; // Quantity of the product

let total = a * b; // Calculate total cost

// More Descriptive Variable Names

let productPrice = 10; // Price of the product

let productQuantity = 5; // Quantity of the product

let totalPrice = productPrice * productQuantity; // Calculate total cost

/*In this example, the version with descriptive variable names (productPrice, productQuantity, and totalPrice) is
much more understandable. Anyone reading the code can quickly deduce that it calculates the total cost of a
product based on its price and quantity. The version with less descriptive names (a, b, and total) is cryptic and
requires additional mental effort to decipher. Choosing meaningful variable names greatly enhances code
readability and comprehension.*/
