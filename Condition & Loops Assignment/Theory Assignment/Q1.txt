Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.

There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including:

“If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
“Else” statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.
“Else if” statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.
